            <p class="hero__text">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
